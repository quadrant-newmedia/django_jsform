### 2.2.0
`jsform_execresponse` now handles `jsformerror` events in addition to `jsformsuccess`.

`js_response.set_form_errors()` now returns a 400 status code by default. This means you can use this response to handle form errors, and return a simple HttpResponse() for successful forms (letting a custom inline handler define what to do for successful form submissions).

### 2.1.1

## 2.1.0
