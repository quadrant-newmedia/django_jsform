## 3.8.0
elementmerge - fire `elementmergecomplete` event when done.

## 3.7
Give event handlers and execresponse access to `submitting_button`.

### 3.6.2
`js_response.reset_form()` bug fix (and default `unblock_form` to True)

### 3.6.1
Changed `.block` css -> setting left/right margin to 'auto' has no effect on any layout _we_ create, but can cause problems if users are using this class for other layouts on their sites. No longer set left/right margin at all.

## 3.6.0
Add means of passing custom selectors to elementmerge.

### 3.5.2
elementmerge - don't `setAttribute()` if unchanged - was causing stylesheets to unapplied/reapplied, causing FOUC

### 3.5.1 
broken update - forgot to commit submodule

## 3.5.0
js_response module now generates responses which can be added together

## 3.4.0
Added new template ("inline_field.html") for rendering fields in one line

## 3.3.0
Updated jsform.js - add more properties to `jsformsuccess` and `jsformerror` events.

## 3.2.0
Better template generation for single checkboxes

### 3.1.3
Bug fix - handle the case where form controls have names that clash with js form attributes. Still don't properly handle the case where a control has name "elements", but at least throw a meaningful error.

### 3.1.2
Bug fix in elementmerge - ensure that multiple consecutive nodes will be deleted if not present in new DOM (previously it would only delete the first removed node).

### 3.1.1
`elementmerge.reload()` bug fix - keep query string

## 3.1.0
`jsform_elementmerge.js` enhancements - `[elementmerge-whitelist]` directive, and global `elementmerge` object for usage without `jsform.js`. See README for jsform for details.

# 3.0.0
`elementmerge.js` now merges the `head`, as well as the `body`. Set `elementmerge-nomerge` on the `head` if you want to retain old behaviour.

## 2.3.0
Templates now set `aria-invalid="true"` when rendering invalid form inputs (`set_form_errors.js` always did this, and `django_jsform.css` depends on it for styling).

### 2.2.2
Drop usage of NavTricks in `js_response.replace_location()`, since NavTricks's implementation of `replaceCurrentPage` never worked right, and has been dropped in recent versions.

### 2.2.1
Set proper `this` inside inline event handlers.

## 2.2.0
`jsform_execresponse` now handles `jsformerror` events in addition to `jsformsuccess`.

`js_response.set_form_errors()` now returns a 400 status code by default. This means you can use this response to handle form errors, and return a simple HttpResponse() for successful forms (letting a custom inline handler define what to do for successful form submissions).

### 2.1.1
Fixed several IE bugs.

## 2.1.0
Added inline event handler support.

# 2.0.0
Various bug fixes, added tests.

Breaking changes:
- removed \[push-query\]

# 1.0.0
